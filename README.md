## Overview
This project creates a tune player by writing a sketch using Arduino programming language which plays a tune and outputs the sound to a piezo buzzer.
### Materials
The project uses the following components:
- Teensy 3.2 microcontroller
- Piezo Buzzer
- 10k Ω resistor
- Wires (various lengths)
- Breadboard (with conductive aluminum plating on the bottom)
### Software
The project uses the following software:
- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/OldSoftwareReleases#previous) (Version 1.8.13)
- [Teensyduino add-on for Arduino IDE](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/teensyduino.html)
- [Teensy Loader](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/loader.html)
- [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/)
### Circuit Layout
The circuit designs are presented in two directories for convenience.
